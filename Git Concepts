Concepts of Git:
Repository (Repo): A storage space where your project and its history are kept.
Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the code, accompanied by a commit message describing the changes.
Branch: A parallel version of the repository, allowing for isolated development and experimentation.
Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another.
Pull Request (PR): Proposed changes that you submit for review and potential inclusion.

Basic Git Commands:
git init: Initializes a new Git repository.
git add <filename>: Adds changes to be committed.
git commit -m "Commit message": Records changes to the repository.
git status: Displays the state of your working directory.
git branch: Lists all local branches.
git merge <branch>: Merges changes from the specified branch into the current branch.
git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
git push: Sends local changes to a remote repository.

Git Hosting Platforms:
GitHub: A web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration features.
GitLab: Similar to GitHub but offers additional features, including continuous integration.
Bitbucket: Provides hosting for projects that use Mercurial or Git, with features like Bitbucket Pipelines for CI/CD.

Industrial Practices:
Branching Strategies: Develop features in separate branches, merging into the main branch upon completion.
Commit Messages: Write clear, concise messages describing the purpose of each commit.
Code Reviews: Use PRs for peer review to maintain code quality.

Cloning a Repo to Local:
Copy the repository URL.
Open a terminal and run git clone <repository_url>.
